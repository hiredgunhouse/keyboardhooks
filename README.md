Keyboard Hooks
=============

This program changes Ctrl to act as either Ctrl (when pressed in combination with other key) or Esc (when pressed and release).
Additionally when Ctrl is pressed and released after specified (configurable) timeout no key is sent.

Warning:
This program has been done very quickly and "works on my machine" (Windows 7 EN 64-bit).
It has been tested only on 3 machines.

Pull requests are welcomed.

Known problems:
Does not work on Windows 7 PL 64-bit (tested on a single machine)

TODO:

- minimize to tray
